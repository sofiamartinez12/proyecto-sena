            <p>Once upon a time there was a princess named Snow White who lived with her father and stepmother in a kingdom far away. The stepmother was very beautiful but arrogant and proud, and she spent all day looking at herself in the mirror. The sorceress queen had a magic mirror to which she asked who was the most beautiful of all, and when Snow White turned seventeen, the mirror answered that she was the most beautiful. The jealous queen ordered a huntsman to murder Snow White in the forest, but the huntsman repented and let her escape.</p>
