            <p>Robin Hood is a brave young man who lived in Sherwood Forest, in Nottingham. Along with his best friend, Little John, they spent their days stealing from the rich to give to the poor. The narrative work that circulates to this day is by an anonymous author and is a kind of epic story made up of more than thirty ballads, compiled under the name The gest of Robin Hood, and printed around the year 1500, giving an account of various passages of the life of the protagonist. There is also a free adaptation that narrates one of the adventures of Robin Hood, based on the popular English legend of the brave young man who takes justice into his own hands by confronting King “John Without Lands” to prevent him from taking their money from the poor.</p>
